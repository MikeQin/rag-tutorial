## Migration Guide

### From Direct OpenAI API
If you're migrating from a direct OpenAI API implementation:

1. Update your API key from `OPENAI_API_KEY` to `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
2. Change the base URL to `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1`
3. Update model names to include provider prefix (e.g., `openai/gpt-3.5-turbo`)
4. Optionally add model selection logic for cost optimization

### From Other RAG Tutorials
If you're coming from other RAG implementations:

1. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Set up OpenRouter API key
3. Start with `simple_demo.py` to understand concepts
4. Progress through `basic_rag.py` → `advanced_rag.py` → `applications.py`
5. Customize for your specific use case
