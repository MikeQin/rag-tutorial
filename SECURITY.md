## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability in this RAG tutorial, please report it by:

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Send an email to: [security@your-domain.com] (replace with actual email)
3. Include as much detail as possible:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

## Security Considerations for RAG Systems

When implementing RAG systems based on this tutorial, please consider:

### 1. API Key Security
- Never commit API keys to version control
- Use environment variables or secure key management
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Implement proper access controls

### 2. Data Privacy
- Be aware of what data you're sending to external APIs
- Consider data residency requirements
- Implement data anonymization when possible
- Review API provider privacy policies

### 3. Input Validation
- Sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks
- Implement rate limiting
- Validate file uploads carefully
- Use allowlists for acceptable file types

### 4. Vector Database Security
- Secure your vector database with proper authentication
- Implement access controls
- Regular backups and encryption at rest
- Monitor for unauthorized access

### 5. Model Security
- Be aware of prompt injection risks
- Implement output filtering
- Monitor for unusual model behavior
- Use models from trusted sources

## Best Practices

### Development
- Use virtual environments
- Keep dependencies updated
- Implement proper logging
- Use secure coding practices

### Production
- Use HTTPS for all communications
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Monitor system behavior
- Have incident response procedures

### Data Handling
- Minimize data collection
- Implement data retention policies
- Secure data transmission
- Regular security audits

## Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Investigation**: Within 1 week
- **Fix Development**: Timeline depends on severity
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is available and users have time to update

## Updates

Security updates will be communicated through:
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Release notes
- Documentation updates

Thank you for helping keep this project secure!
